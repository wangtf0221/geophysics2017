\begin{abstract}
%Elastic full waveform inversion (EFWI) provides high-resolution parameter estimation of the
%subsurface but requires good initial guess of the true model.
Elastic reflection waveform inversion (ERWI) utilize the reflections to update the low and
intermediate wavenumber in the deeper part of elastic model, which can provide good initial models
for elastic full waveform inversion (EFWI). Though ERWI can mitigate the nonlinearity to some
extent, it is still stuck with the cycle-skipping problem due to the objective function of waveform fitting. 
%the cycle-skipping of traveltime
%objective function will be less severe
%compared with the previous one. 
%Therefore, 
Building initial P and S wave velocity models for EFWI through elastic wave-equation
reflections traveltime inversion (ERTI) would be effective and robust
since traveltime information relates to the background model more linearly. 
The wave mode decomposition, both on the recording surface and in the underground space, are important for ERTI.
On the one hand,
P/S separation of multicomponent seismograms on the surface provides 
individual P or S wave data residuals.
Thus, we implement the ERTI using the $L_2$ norm of the isolated P or S wave traveltime
residuals extracted by the dynamic image warping (DIW) as objective function.
On the other hand, the underground spatial wave mode decomposition provides separated wavefields to precondition
the kernels or gradients.
However, the reflection kernels in elastic media are complicated and difficult to use, especially when
calculating the gradient of S-wave
velocity. The investigation of reflection kernels show that mode decomposition can suppress the artifacts in
gradient calculation. 
%Besides, the model regularization through local dip-dependent smooth filter ensures the inversion converging to a
%geological model. 
Accordingly, a two-step inversion strategy is adopted to effectively reduce the nonlinearity of inversion, in which PP reflections are first used to invert $V_p$,
followed by $V_s$ inversion with PS reflections based on the well recovered $V_p$. 
%To avoid the mismeasurement of PS traveltime residual, the well recovered PP image are used to
%generate the PS reflections. 
%Through the layer stripping strategy, we rebuild the background elastic
%model from shallow the deep.
%P/S separation of multicomponent seismograms  spatial wave mode
%decomposition provides P or S wavefields, which help
%to  reduce the nonlinearty of inversion effectively.
%The kernel of reflection wavepath proves that mode decomposition can surpress the artifacts in
%the reflection inversion. 
Numerical example of Sigsbee2A model validates the effectiveness of the
algorithms and strategies for ERTI.
%Synthetic example on the Sigbee2A model proves the validity
%of our method for recovering the long wavelength components of the model.
%Numerical example of Sigsbee2A model validates the effectivenss of the 
%algorithms and strategies for EWERTI, whose results also are tested through EFWI.
