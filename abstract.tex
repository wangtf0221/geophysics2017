Full waveform inversion (FWI) has been proved a powerful tool for accurate description
of the subsurface. Recently, elastic FWI (EFWI) is coming into use to get a more
accurate velocity.Current EFWI procedures (references to be added), they all convolute the
two mixed wavefield, the foward and backward propagated wavefields, to get the
gradient of a particular parameter.However, this method may distort the gradient or
may lead to serious trade-off between parameters.We analyse the radiation patterns of
different wave modes with separated wavefields.The results show that this scheme will
strengthen the scattered wave energy and also it may help to alleviate the trade-off between 
parameters.
