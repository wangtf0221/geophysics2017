\subsection{Transmitted geometry} 
For transmitted waves, the incident and scattered angles are the same, the components
of slowness vectors satisfy:
\begin{align}
  p^s_1&=sin\theta,\\
  p^s_3&=cos\theta,\\
  p^r_1&=-sin\theta,\\
  p^r_3&=-cos\theta.
  \label{SlownessVector}
\end{align}
Thus we can plot the radiation patterns in isotropic media:
\inputdir{Iso.transmit}
Substitue the slowness vectors into equation \ref{eq:ChristoffelEquation} and solve
the eigenvalue problem will give us the plorization vectors $\mathbf{g}^M_i$. Then we
can plot the radiation patterns in terms of transmitted waves.

Assume the model is homogeneous anisotropic with parameters:
\begin{align}
  V_{P0}&=3000m/s,\\
  V_{S0}&=1500m/s,\\
  \epsilon&=0.2,\\
  \delta&=0.1.
  \label{ThomsenParameter}
\end{align}
Through the metioned procedures we have the following results (Figure 1).From figure 
1 can see that in the PP mode there is no energy scattered from $V_{S0}$ 
perturbation.And the scattered wave energy from perturbation of $V_{P0}$ has a
maximum along the direction of symmetry axis and goes to zero in the horizontal
direction.While the perturbation of $V_{hor}$ produces a maximum wave energy in the
horizontal direction and reduces to zero of toward the symmetry axis.The perturbation
of $V_{nmo}$ has a four times smaller maximum than that of $V_{P0}$ along the angle of
$45^{\circ}$ with the symmetry axis.

	Also, the PS mode and SP mode have the same
form.One interesting thing is that in this two modes the influence of $\Omega(V_{S0})$ is
zero.The maximum of $\Omega(V_{P0})$ appears around the angle of $45^{\circ}$ with the
symmetry axis.But $\Omega(V_{hor})$ reaches its maximum almost around the angle of
$60^{\circ}$ with the symmetry axis.In another word, the influnce of $V_{hor}$ seems
more ``horizontal''.

	In the SS mode (Figure 1(d)), the perturbation of $V_{S0}$ scatters the wave
energy uniformly.As expected, the $\Omega(V_{P0})$ has no impact on the scattered S
wavefield.For the perturbation of $V_{nmo}$ in the SS mode,it has an oppsite value 
of $\Omega(V_{nmo})$ in the PP mode for every angle.And $V_{hor}$ is identical to
$V_{nmo}$.That is why we can't see the blue line for $V_{nmo}$ in Figure 1(d)
(overlapped by the magenta line for $V_{hor}$).

	Now we have all the radiation patterns with different wave modes and different
parameter perturbations.Next we can analyse how the mixed wavefield will affect on the
radiation patterns. First, we consider the simplest case of $V_{S0}$.From Figure 1 we
can conclude that the perturbation of $V_{S0}$ only affect on the scattered S
wavefield.

{Four types of radiation pattern in terms of velocity perturbations,
  $V_{P0}$(red), $V_{S0}$(green), $V_{nmo}$(blue) and
  $V_{hor}$(magenta) respectively.(a):PP mode,(b):PS mode,(c):SP mode,(d):SS mode.}

Assume that the P and S wavefield will arrive at the perturbation location at the same
time.Under this assumption we can combine the different radiation patterns with simple
addition and subtraction to analyse the effect of mixed wavefield on the radiation
patterns.For $V_{P0}$, the SS mode will not affect the scattered energy.
Figure 2(a) shows the different wave mode combinations of the perturbation of 
$V_{P0}$.The red line represents the radiation pattern of mixed wavefield (the sum of 
all the three wave modes).We can see that the bule line is the same with 
$\Omega^{PP}(V_{P0})$, because the $\Omega^{PS}(V_{P0})$-$\Omega^{SP}(V_{P0})=0$
(we have mentioned above).However, the green
line and red line have a equivalent maximum but around different angle with the
symmetry axis.Also, the maximum is larger than that of $\Omega^{PP}(V_{P0})$, i.e. the
scheme of red or green line will amplify the energy scattered by the
$V_{P0}$ perturbation.So for the $V_{P0}$, the radiation pattern of the mixed
wavefield will have a larger maximum around the angle of $30^{\circ}$ with the
symmetry axis.

  Figure 3 show the different wave mode combinations of $V_{hor}$.The red line represents the 
radiation pattern of mixed wavefield (the sum of all the four wave modes).Similar with
$V_{P0}$, the PS mode and SP mode of $V_{hor}$ behave the same with each other, i.e.
$\Omega^{PS}(V_{hor})$-$\Omega^{SP}(V_{hor})=0$.So the radiation pattern of mixed
wavefields will have a larger maximum around the angle of $30^{\circ}$ with the
horizontal axis.

  and magenta line:
  $\Omega^{PP}(V_{P0})$+$\Omega^{PS}(V_{P0})$+$\Omega^{SP}(V_{P0})$-$\Omega^{SS}(V_{hor})$.}

  For $V_{nmo}$ there are some differences from the other two perturbations.In Figure
4, we actually have four types of combinations as in the desciption of the
figure.However, the blue line of $\Omega^{PP}(V_{nmo})$+$\Omega^{SS}(V_{nmo})$ does not
appear.The reason is that the the summation of
$\Omega^{PP}(V_{nmo})$ and $\Omega^{SS}(V_{nmo})$ equals zero.From Figure 1(a) and
1(d) we know that $\Omega^{PP}(V_{nmo})$ and $\Omega^{SS}(V_{nmo})$ have a same form,
now here we know that they have the same value with oppsite sign.So if using the mixed
wavefield to get the radiation pattern, we will have the red line in Figure 4.It looks
complex with small amplitude.If we use the scheme of green line, the amplitude will
reaches a larger maximum of 0.5 around the angle of $45^{\circ}$ with the symmetry
axis.However, the largest amplitude appears when we use the scheme of magenta line.And
the angle of maximum goes to about $300^{\circ}$ with the symmetry axis.The scheme of
magenta line will strengthen the scattered energy of $V_{nmo}$, which may help to
give us a better gradient of $V_{nmo}$ to recover a better $\delta$.
