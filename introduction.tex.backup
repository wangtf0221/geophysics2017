\section{Introduction}
Quantitative imaging of the subsurface is essential for characterizing
petroleum reservoirs, monitoring injected CO$_2$ and evaluating near-surface soil or rock properties.
A depth model that quantifies the elastic properties is more desirable than qualitative
stacked images of reflectivity obtained through seismic migration.
With the emergence of lone-offset wide-azimuth acquisitions and broad-band sources,
full waveform inversion (FWI) has been recognized as an
efficient tool for constructing velocity models and quantitative seismic imaging; see \cite{virieux2009overview} for a review.
Though the acoustic FWI, primaryly focusing on P-wave velocity inversion, has been
widely studied in the past decades
\cite[e.g.]{tarantola1984,pratt1998gauss,shipp:2002}, people are paying more attention
to the waveform inversion under the elastic assumption, refered to as elastic full waveform inversion
(EFWI) \cite[]{tanrantola1986}.
EFWI provides high-resolution model estimation of the elastic properties but also
notoriously surfers from the nonlinearities of
multi-parameter inversion and also the same cycle-skipping problem as in acoustic
case \cite[]{sears:2008,brossier2009}.
To deal with the chanllenges cycle-skipping problems and parameter trade-offs, more
preconditions, hierarchical strategies and parameterization should be considered
\cite[]{sears:2008,prieux:2013b,operto2013guided,wang:2015,Oh2016}.

In the surface observation geometry, full waveform inversion (FWI) often suffers from the
local minimal due to the absense of low frequencies in the data when the low-wavenumber
component is missing in the initial model.
In the classical FWI, the long-offset data
corresponding to diving waves are very important to build the long-to-intermediate
wavelengths of the model. However, the penetration depths of
diving waves are always far from sufficient to reach the target in the deeper part
with the limited surface offset,
even using the wide-azimuth surveys. 
In addtion, the signal-to-noise level at the far
offset is low. Therefore, reflected waves should be included to help build the
macro-model containing long-to-intermediate component.

Building the long-to-intermediate components with the reflection information can be
implemented in the image domain or the data domain. 
In the image domain, the ray-based tomography \cite[]{(Pratt and Goulty, 1991;
Shipp and Singh,2002; Operto et al., 2004} update the background velocity by flatting the common
image gathers. However, the ray-based method will fail to
present the real case of wave propagation in case of complex heterogeneties. 
Alternatively, this task also can be fulfilled by the wave equation method 
through minizing the energy of
non-zero offset on the extended-domain gathers \cite[]{Symes, 2008; Fleury
and Perrone, 2012; Biondi and Almomin, 2013}.
The extended-domain methods are limited due to its prohibitively computational cost,
especially in three-dimension case.
While in the data domain,
\cite{xu:2012} suggested using a reflection waveform inversion (RWI) method, 
which aim to invert the long-wavelength components of the model by using the reflections 
predicted by migration/demigration process.
Through minimizing misfit function of waveform, the RWI method are developed
by several work \cite[]{Wu2015b,Zhou2015}, and recently extended to elastic case by
\cite{Guo2016}.

%\cite{Zhou2015} proposed a joint FWI method to combine the diving and reflected waves to
%utilize both the conventional FWI and RWI.
%In addition, \cite{Wang:2015} found that wave mode decomposition may be beneficial to deal with the
%elastic parameter trade-offs.
However, traveltime information are more sensitive and linearly related to
low-wavenumber model perturbation. Using traveltime inversion will be more robust and helpful to
build appropriate initial models containing long-wavelength components for
conventional FWI \cite[]{Ma2013, Wang2015,Chi2015, Luo2016}.
Unfortunately, in elastic case, traveltimes of a particular wave modes are difficult
to extract due to the complicated mode-conversions.
It is common to observe that different mode-conversions, mainly P-P
and P-S events, overlap and intersect with each other. The cross points between events
would be singularities for traveltime difference estimation even using the local shift estimation 
method like dynamic image warping (DIW).
Therefore, the estimated travletime differences would be inaccurate if using the
original multicomponent seismic data, which makes the elastic WERTI difficult to implement.
And also more hierarchical strategies should be considered to deal with the multi-parameter inversion problem.

In this paper,
we aim to tackle the traveltime misfits of P-P and P-S reflections with the help
of wave mode decomposition and dynamic image warping (DIW) \cite[]{Hale2013}.
Then, we use the traveltime of P-P and P-S reflections to implement the 
WERTI method \cite[]{Ma2013} with a two-stage workflow.
Finally, the numerical example of Sigsee2A model proves the robustness and validity of our
elastic WERTI method.
